         The goal is the profitable production of chemical C.
         which can be produced from chemical B where B may be
         the raw material that can be purchased from the
         external market or an intermediate that is produced
         from raw material A. There are two alternative paths
         of producing B from A. A mixed-integer nonlinear
         formulation is presented to solve the optimal prod-
         -uction and capacity expansion problem.
